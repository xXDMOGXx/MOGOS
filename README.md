# MOGOS
A custom ComputerCraft GUI based Operating System entirely designed and developed by DMOG.
The name is a merge between DMOG and OS, hence MOGOS.
Any OS files and seperate programs relating to the MOGOS environment will be posted here.

This is a current very heavy WIP.
Code will be pushed here from my editor as I work on it. A Pastebin installer will be created soon.
Milestones and releases are showcased and explained on my YouTube channel at https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC55WbvBuB1ENqmYOXvtweGg.
A lot of the code will be without comments until I decide to take the time to add them. Sorry not sorry.

A little about me. I'm a highschool programmer who likes coding. I decided one day that I wanted to push my skills and make a ComputerCraft Operating System.
I wanted it to have a lot of features, half of which I have already prototyped or nearly completed (!).
- ! Custom Display API with versatility for any program and dynamicly stored maps (File that tells the custom interpreter where every color, text, image, and function is)
- ! Custom Image Compression for large scale image storage
- ! Custom In-Game Asset Creation Program (Basically MS Paint ripoff)
- Custom Sound System
- Custom Animation System
- Full GUI based file browsing
- Custom App Store and developer tools

Feel free to message me on discord for any suggestions, whether it be features, or telling me to stop coding like a monkey and change something specific. xXDMOGXx#0597.
